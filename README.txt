Thank you for downloading my game!
In this game you will become a university student.  While going through 
different courses you will be able to use key items to establish a knowledge
base on those sujects.  Once you are able to go to every class you will then be 
able to take a final exam.  The final exam is challenging so most students go
to class first.  I highly suggest so!  Once you have gone to all your 
classes and taken the final exam, you will then be able to go to an award
ceremony to receive your dimploma!  This will be an exciting day.  Once you 
have your diploma you win the game!
